# Lambda AI Hackathon App

An AI-powered serverless application built for the **AWS Lambda Hackathon**. This project demonstrates how scalable solutions can be developed using AWS Lambda, Amazon Bedrock (for generative AI), and other AWS services to solve real-world problems.

## ğŸš€ Project Objective

To build a serverless application that integrates Amazon Bedrock foundation models to:
- Rephrase and enhance user-provided technical content
- Generate summaries or documentation on the fly
- Provide contextual AI assistance via API Gateway + Lambda
- Showcase practical use of GenAI in cloud-native serverless workflows

## ğŸ§° Tech Stack

- **AWS Lambda**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **API Gateway**
- **Amazon S3**
- **DynamoDB** (Optional for storing user input/output)
- **AWS Step Functions** (Optional for orchestration)
- **Python / Node.js** (based on Lambda runtime)

## ğŸ”§ Use Case

The application allows users to submit rough or raw technical content through an API endpoint. The content is passed through a Lambda function, which calls an Amazon Bedrock model to:
- Polish the language
- Improve readability
- Add beginner-friendly explanations
- Return the enhanced content in real-time

This enables use cases like:
- Automating technical documentation generation
- Summarizing blog posts
- Rewriting DevOps guides
- AI-assisted knowledge transformation

## ğŸ’¡ Features

- Fully serverless
- Low-latency GenAI processing using Bedrock
- Scalable and event-driven
- Clean, human-readable, and SEO-optimized content output

## ğŸ§ª Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your AWS environment
3. Deploy Lambda function(s) using SAM or Serverless Framework
4. Connect API Gateway to expose public endpoints
5. (Optional) Store results in DynamoDB or S3
